# Project-Black-Lotus

is now located at: [BlackLotus](https://github.com/RedactedProfile/BlackLotus)

Project-Black-Lotus was the original project title before I liked Black Lotus enough as a name to just use and adopt it.  
Truthfully, "Project-Black-Lotus" looked ugly in the URL and title space. So I renamed the repo from Project-Black-Lotus to simply [BlackLotus](https://github.com/RedactedProfile/BlackLotus)

This page is here to catch old URL's and inform them of the new URL.
